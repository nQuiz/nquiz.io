# Quizzes - COMING SOON

It is possible to partake in public quizzes, multiplayer quiz games, and also to create private tests for students.  All quizzes have 12 questions.

## Taken
This section lets you review all the Quizzes you have taken, from any of the games - it's a chance to review your scores, and compare your position against other players.

## Public
A public quiz contains 12 questions and costs 21 sats to play.  Choose a single topic, and if you pass (75% or more) you get 20 rep.  If you get 100%, you get 30 rep.  A count of passed sessions (by topic) is displayed on your public profile.

### How are public quizzes created?
A job runs at 4am to perform the following logic:

* Filter for Approved, non-deleted questions with > 3 votes
* If there are enough new questions in the pool, create a new quiz for that tag
* Questions are split by pass rate - 6 at >= 70%, and 6 below 70%.

There must be a minimum of 36 questions before the first quiz is created.  At 48 questions the second quiz is created, at 60 the third - etc etc.

## Multiplayer
Available to players of Level 6 and above (unless unlocked with tokens), multiplayer lets you create an interactive challenge!  Once in a ready room, you can use the instant chat to communicate.  When ready, click the 'get started' button to begin play.  The winner is the one with the most correct answers, if it's a tie then it's the player with the fastest finish time. The organiser pays for the game (100 sats) and also gets to choose which tags are used to filter the questions.

## Custom
This feature, unlocked at Level 7, lets you build a quiz for your students to enjoy.  You can choose from all questions that have at least 4 upvotes.  It will cost 21 sats for each student you wish to take the test.  You are able to review their scores, and see the overall leaderboard results.
