# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why do I need The Nostr?

The Nostr protocol provides a number of significant benefits to the game:

* No need to create a new account (use your existing profile)
* Easy to prevent notifications (just remove our relay from your list of relays)
* Native payments (Bitcoin over Lightning)
* Discoverability
* Authentication

If you're new to Nostr, check out [this guide](https://nostr.how/en/get-started)

## Why do I need Bitcoin (BTC)?

We charge small amounts of bitcoin to eliminate spam, to compensate the contributors, and to fund game development.  Devs and servers are not free, unfortunately!  To get yourself some bitcoin, follow [this guide](https://learn.robosats.com/docs/quick-start/).

## What are Sats?

Sats (Satoshis) are units of bitcoin.  1 BTC = 100,000,000 Sats.


## Why was my question reported?
There are a number of ways to write a bad question.  Examples (no particular order):

* Opinionated question (eg, what is the 'best' or 'most effective' way to do XXX)
* Poor grammar / spelling mistakes
* Images in questions that have large file sizes (these can be slow to load on mobile devices)
* Use of unformatted code (use backticks or indent with 4 spaces to style as code)
* Use of code lines over 32 chars (causes scrolling on mobile)
* No links to further information (remember, the aim is to TEACH)
* No explanation, just reiteration of the question (remember, the aim is to TEACH)
* Question is too obvious / too easy / inappropriate
* Question is too obscure / not something a professional would or should know

Sometimes a question may be downvoted without good reason - and so a system is in place to prevent a review being triggered for already-proven questions.  The rules are as follows:

Question has 5 or fewer zaps: Report by Level 2 player or above will trigger review
Question has 6-10 zaps: Report by Level 3 player or above will trigger review
Question has 11-20 zaps: Report by Level 4 player or above will trigger review
Question has 21-30 zaps: Report by Level 5 player  or above will trigger review
Question has 31 or more zaps: Report by Level 6 or 7 player will trigger review


## How does question linking work?

It is necessary to provide some level of protection over the direct viewing of questions for a number of reasons:

* To prevent scraping of the entire question bank
* To limit ability to share own questions to 'game' the voting system
* To limit the ability to cheat

However, being able to access questions directly is necessary for purposes of education (review), quality control, and for building custom quizzes.  The 'rules' therefore for being able to access a question directly are as follows:

1) User is Admin (can view all questions)
2) User is Level 7 or above (can view all questions)
3) User is the question creator
4) User has played the question before
5) Question is in review, and the user is Level 4 or above

In all other cases, there will be a small charge of 21 sats to play the question.
