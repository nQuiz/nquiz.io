# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why do I need The Nostr?

The Nostr protocol provides a number of significant benefits to the game:

* No need to create a new account (use your existing profile)
* Easy to prevent notifications (just remove our relay from your list of relays)
* Native payments (Bitcoin over Lightning)
* Discoverability
* Authentication

If you're new to Nostr, check out [this guide](https://nostr.how/en/get-started)

## Why do I need Bitcoin (BTC)?

We charge small amounts of bitcoin to eliminate spam, to compensate the contributors, and to fund game development.  Devs and servers are not free, unfortunately!  To get yourself some bitcoin, follow [this guide](https://learn.robosats.com/docs/quick-start/).

## What are Sats?

Sats (Satoshis) are units of bitcoin.  1 BTC = 100,000,000 Sats.


## How does question linking work?

It is necessary to provide some level of protection over the direct viewing of questions for a number of reasons:

* To prevent scraping of the entire question bank
* To limit ability to share own questions to 'game' the voting system
* To limit the ability to cheat

However, being able to access questions directly is necessary for purposes of education (review), quality control, and for building custom quizzes.  The 'rules' therefore for being able to access a question directly are as follows:

1) User is Admin (can view all questions)
2) User is Level 7 or above (can view all questions)
3) User is the question creator
4) User has played the question before
5) Question is in review, and the user is Level 4 or above

In all other cases, there will be a small charge of 21 sats to play the question.
