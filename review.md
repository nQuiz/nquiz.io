# Review

There are infinite ways to write a bad question!  Examples (no particular order):

* Images in questions that have large file sizes (can be slow to load on a poor connection)
* Use of unformatted code (use backticks or indent with 4 spaces to style as code)
* No explanation, just reiteration of the question (remember, the aim is to TEACH)
* Opinionated question (eg, what is the 'best' or 'most effective' way to do XXX)
* No links to further information (remember, the aim is to TEACH)
* Use of code lines over 32 chars (causes scrolling on mobile)
* Question is too obvious / too easy / inappropriate
* Question is obscure / irrelevant to the app
* Poor grammar / spelling mistakes
* Irrelevant tags

The review process (unlocked at Level 4) allows players to review the new and modified questions being submitted by others.

This moderation step is important to ensure the quality, accuracy, and relevance of the content being created.

Questions are analysed across six dimensions (with a pass/fail for each):

* Perfect Spelling
* Correct Grammar
* Relevant Tags
* Factual and Precise
* Adequately Explained
* Properly Formatted

If a question receives three fails in any of the above dimensions, the revision is rejected.

Each question / question revision must receive three passes in all 6 dimensions to be approved for release.
