# Review

This feature is unlocked at Level 4, and allows players to review the new and modified questions being submitted by others.

This moderation step is important to ensure the quality, accuracy, and relevance of the content being created.

Questions are analysed across six dimensions (with a pass/fail for each):

* Perfect Spelling
* Correct Grammar
* Relevant Tags
* Factual and Precise
* Adequately Explained
* Properly Formatted

If a question receives three fails in any of the above dimensions, the revision is rejected.

Each question / question revision must receive three passes in all 6 dimensions to be approved for release.
