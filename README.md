# nQuiz - The Nostr Quiz Platform

## The Problem

There are many (many) quiz games on the internet, so why build a new one?  

Problems with most quizzes:

* Questions have no difficulty rating (where do you start?)
* Questions have no explanations (how do you learn?)
* Poor quality questions (no rating / review system)
* Require excessive personal info (eg, email)
* Lack of monetisation for question creators
* No way to create your own quizzes


nQuiz is a _platform_ built to support any number of quiz games, each with:

* A unique name / domain (eg TOPIC.nquiz.io)
* A unique theme / graphics
* Unique levels
* Certificates (coming soon)
* Leaderboard (coming soon)


By passing questions and quizzes, and especially by submitting (quality) content, you will earn reputation that can be used to unlock the later levels.  These include multiplayer, and the ability to create your own tests.

Current games include:
